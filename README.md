# Simplified-8086-Microprocessor
CMPE127 Lab project backup

This is the last Lab project of my CMPE127 course in SJSU. The lab manual is in the Doc folder in this repository. The project initially provides the basic motherboard (page 4 of the CMPE 127 Lab Manual). I used the SJ-Two board(https://github.com/kammce/SJSU-Dev2) as my development board to write and read data for the board I design. As you can see in the Simplified 8086 Microprocessor Schematic (in the Doc folder), there are some SRAM, TTL chips (AND, OR, XOR, NOT, NAND, Flip-flop, etc.), 4x4 keypad, LCD (1602a) to construct the basic function of the computer. This board has memory and I/O sections that you can use the keypad to do the simple calculation (+, -, * and /). The source code is provided in the Source Code folder. Following are the images of the final design without the SJ2 board of both front and back:
